# Research Experiences

## Pharmacokinetic Study of Cefuroxime in Rabbits

Sept. 2020~Nov.2020, Advisor: Guoping ZHONG

i. Took experiments on 48 rabbits divided into 6 groups by doses (low: 25mg/kg, medium: 50mg/kg and high: 100mg/kg) and administration routes (intravenous injection and intragastric administration)

ii. Calculated pharmacokinetic parameters of cefuroxime in every rabbit including Tmax, Cmax, T1/2, AUC, Cl, Vd and MRT

iii. Cleaned the data and used SPSS to conduct statistical analyses such as test of normality, estimation of population mean, linear regression analysis, ANOVA and rank sum test

iv. Characterized the in vivo pharmacokinetic process of cefuroxime with single compartment model, two-compartment model and non-compartment model

## Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program

### Influence of Glucose and Lactic Acid’s Double Blocking on Colorectal Cancer’s Growth and PD-L1 Expression

Dec. 2019~May 2020, Advisor: Yanfeng GAO

Purpose: to seek a new cancer therapy by blocking the combination of lactic acid and GPR81 and inhibiting the cancer cells’ ingestion of glucose under the interference of mannose

Research Approach: to choose two kinds of colorectal cancer cells in mice (CT26 and MC38) to conduct in vitro and in vivo experiments, and detect the lactic acid concentration, the cancer cell proliferation and PD-L1 expression

Expected Result: to confirm whether endogenous molecules like alanine can be used as the blocker between lactic acid and GPR81; to learn the impact of inhibiting cancer cells’ ingestion of glucose and recognition of lactic acid on cancer cell proliferation; and to predict the synergy effect between the two aforementioned methods
