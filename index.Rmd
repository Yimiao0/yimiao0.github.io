# A Quick Self Introduction

Hi, this is Yimiao Pang. I'm glad that you're willing to spend a few minutes knowing better about me!

I want to start with my high school. When I was in high school, I already set my life goal as promoting human health development. Therefore, I chose pharmacy as my major at college.

I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in China in the summer of 2021 with a B.S. degree in Pharmacy. This is a photo of me taken when I was about to graduate from SYSU.

Luckily and unluckily, I learnt a lot during my college time but I found myself not the chemistry/biology guy. I was suffering from remembering all the information in thousands of pages every final week. I even cried the first time I had to kill a mouse in experiment. I still feel sorry for that little friend. Whatever, considering that I would never take the wet-lab stuff as my career and that I might be good at math, I decided to change my major into biostatistics.

After graduation from SYSU, I was admitted to Columbia University to study Biostatistics which I have great passion for. Now I am a first-year student in MS program for Biostatistics Theory & Methods track. I'm not suffering any more. On the contrary, I'm worried every day that I cannot spend all of my time studying biostat! I love my current major!

Here is a photo of me taken in the Columbia main campus, despite the fact that biostat students live and study at Irving Medical Center far from our beautiful campus. And of course, I'm a good girl wearing my mask.
